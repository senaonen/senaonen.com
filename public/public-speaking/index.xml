      <description>&lt;p&gt;Unlock the secrets to striking the perfect balance between independence and control within your organization with Adrián Moreno Peña, Director of Engineering at SumUp, in this episode of Tech Leaders Hub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With over 4 million vendors relying on their products, SumUp is a leading provider of financial services for small businesses. As the Director of Engineering, Adrian leads a team of over 50 people, including 30+ engineers, responsible for the development of online invoicing and accounting tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the key challenges facing Adrian and his team is how to balance the need for individual growth with the needs of the larger organization. By focusing on helping others grow and succeed, Adrian has been able to foster a culture of collaboration and success within his team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this episode, we explored topics such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to foster a culture of innovation and sustainability within a larger organization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The benefits of allowing smaller units to operate with a startup mentality within a company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The importance of setting clear investments and goals for each unit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The role of teaching and mentoring in fostering growth and development within a team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strategies for balancing the needs of the individual with the needs of the larger organization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>🇪🇸 Cosas que (quizás) me hubiese gustado oír al acabar la carrera</title>
      <link>https://senaonen.com/public-speaking/2012-06-08-graduation-speech/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Graduation speech for the students of graduating in 2012 in Computer Engineering in my university, Santiago de Compostela. After graduating in 2007 and having started a company since then, I got the chance to participate in the graduation ceremomy with a speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the best thing is that I thought that the &amp;ldquo;inspirational quote&amp;rdquo; that I used to close the speech was from Steve Jobs - as I had seen attributed in Wikiquote. But it turned to be a joke added to the page - where the quote itself is from a Digimon son 🤷 (&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butter-Fly&#34;&gt;Butter-Fly&lt;/a&gt;, in particular).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  title: "Who am I?"
  content: "<p class='lead'>
    I'm the kind of student who always pays attention to the smallest details, and that commitment has proven invaluable throughout my journey as both a student and researcher. During my B.Sc. studies in Industrial Engineering, I discovered my love for exploring the tiny puzzle pieces of processes and seeing how they fit into the bigger picture.
    </p>
    <p class='lead'>
    Alongside my studies, I had the privilege of actively participating in research on green city logistics, which further fueled my enthusiasm for conducting rigorous research. This opportunity inspired me to pursue my graduate studies. My research addresses a compelling green city project, specifically examining individuals’ intricate behaviors and decision-making processes in their search for parking spaces. My ultimate objective is to devise a comprehensive solution that persuades individuals to abandon their exhaustive quest for parking spaces, effectively reducing carbon emissions and fostering sustainability in our cities.

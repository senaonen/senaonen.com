As part of the B.Sc. program at Middle East Technical University, students are required to undertake a project focused on a real-life industry problem before graduating. In this framework, senior student teams collaborate with a sponsoring organization under faculty supervision. The objective of the course is to enable students to analyze raw data, identify problem areas, develop solutions, and create implementation plans.
Working together as a team, our goal was to design a decision support system that generates daily or weekly production schedules for each work center, with the aim of minimizing the makespan. Analysis of past production data revealed that our project had the potential to significantly improve job completion times, with a possible advancement of up to 30%.

I worked as a research and teaching assistant at Middle East Technical University, renowned as the leading technical university in Turkey, for a period of three years. Throughout this time, I had the opportunity to assist in various courses, including mandatory courses with an average enrollment of 120 students. 

As a research and teaching assistant, my responsibilities encompassed several key tasks, such as preparing and evaluating quizzes, term projects, and case studies. I also conducted weekly recitation sessions and guided students during regular office hours, assisting them with any questions or concerns.

Network Flows and Integer Programming, Stochastic Models in Operations Research, Forecasting Methods (Forecasting with R), and Topics in Optimization are some of the courses that I have assisted. These courses played a key role in expanding my knowledge and deepening my understanding, ultimately guiding me toward new horizons in my academic journey.

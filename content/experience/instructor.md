### Course Instructor

I had the privilege of teaching the course 'Operations Management' to a vibrant class of 35 students. Throughout the course, we delved into a variety of essential topics, placing a particular emphasis on waiting lines, capacity planning, inventory management, and total quality management. By imparting these essential concepts, I aimed to equip my students with the knowledge and skills necessary to excel in the field of operations management.

Recognizing the significance of active learning, I employed various engaging strategies to enhance the learning experience for my students. To facilitate their comprehension and participation, we incorporated online quizzes, and interactive games, and utilized Excel as a simulation tool. These methods not only fostered a dynamic and interactive learning environment but also encouraged students to actively engage with the course material, promoting deeper understanding and knowledge retention.

Average Student Evaluation: 4.6/5

Climate change is of utmost importance in this century. To assess how business education is adapting to this global challenge, my co-authors and I conducted a comprehensive literature review. Our aim was to identify IT-based teaching innovations that effectively incorporate sustainability topics into business school classrooms. Our findings revealed a clear need for a teaching approach that integrates both sustainability and profit-oriented objectives in a practical and realistic manner. Shortly after publishing our literature review, my co-authors successfully released the first version of 'ERPsim Logistics Sustainability' in response to this identified need. This teaching innovation represents a significant step forward in integrating sustainability issues into business education.
